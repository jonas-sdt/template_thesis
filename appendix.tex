\chapter{Name of Appendix}

According to~\cite{JW06}, \enquote{appendices should contain algorithms, detailed proofs,
or derivations only. Appendices can be crucial for overlength papers, but are still
useful otherwise. Think of appendices as random--access substantiation of underlying gory
details.}

As a rule of thumb~\cite{JW06}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Appendices should not contain any material necessary for understanding the
        contributions of the thesis.
    \item Appendices should contain all material that most readers would not be interested
        in.
\end{itemize}
