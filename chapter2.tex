\chapter{Main Body} 

The main body of the thesis is divided into chapters, sections, and subsections which have
meaningful titles. There is no guideline to the number of chapters your main body
comprises. The length of each chapter should reflect its importance within the thesis.
The chapters and sections discuss the main arguments in a logical and consistent order.
Stay logical and focused, never lose your thread. Write for the reader!
