\chapter{Do's and Do Not's}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Always run a spell checker on your thesis. There are no excuses! Is is not the
      task of your supervisor to mark spelling mistakes, and work which clearly violates
      this requirement will be rejected.
    \item English is (most likely) not the native language of the writer. There are
      helpful guidelines for the use of English grammar and scientific writing which are
      beneficial to apply and will improve any thesis: see, e.g., \cite{IEEEstyleguide,
      Gol06} as well as the classic book~\cite{Stu12}.
    \item Please choose whether you would like to write your thesis in British or American
      English. Do not mix the two languages.    
    \item Abbreviations should be initially introduced once (!) in the text, \eg
      \acrfull{ml}. Later on, only the abbreviation \acrshort{ml} should be reused.
\end{itemize}
